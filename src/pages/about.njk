<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is <strong>Tiago Murer</strong>, and I am a Brazilian software developer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.</p>
<p>My journey into programming began unexpectedly. After graduating in law in 2016, I discovered JavaScript through Khan Academy, which ignited my passion for technology.</p>
<p>In 2018, I took a leap of faith to change my career path by enrolling in a technology program. Since then, I have embraced my new vocation and have grown immensely in this field.</p>
<p>Today, I am a Software Engineer with <strong id="exp-years"></strong> years of experience in web development.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm focused on improving my skills in web development backend with <strong>TypeScript</strong> and exploring <strong>cloud technologies</strong>.
<p>When I am not coding, you can find me reading a fantasy or horror novel</p>
<p>Feel free to connect with me!</p>
